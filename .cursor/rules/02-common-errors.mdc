# Common Errors Rule

Common errors include:
- Missing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (see [app/main.py](mdc:app/main.py) and [.env.example](mdc:.env.example)).
- Invalid or missing model filter file (see [models-filter.txt](mdc:models-filter.txt)).
- API errors from OpenRouter are handled and returned as JSON (see [app/api.py](mdc:app/api.py)).
For troubleshooting, refer to [README.md](mdc:README.md) for setup and configuration guidance.
