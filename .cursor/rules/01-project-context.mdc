# Project Context Rule

This project is a FastAPI-based proxy that emulates the Ollama API and forwards requests to OpenRouter. The main API endpoints are implemented in [app/api.py](mdc:app/api.py) and described in [README.md](mdc:README.md):
- `/api/version`: Returns the proxy version.
- `/api/tags`: Lists available models, filtered by [models-filter.txt](mdc:models-filter.txt) if present.
- `/api/chat`: Handles chat completions, supporting both streaming and non-streaming responses.

Model filtering is controlled by the file [models-filter.txt](mdc:models-filter.txt). The proxy can be run locally or via Docker, as described in [Dockerfile](mdc:Dockerfile) and [README.md](mdc:README.md).
